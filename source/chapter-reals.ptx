  <title>The Real and Complex Numbers</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We begin with some basic set theory terminology that may pop up from time to time,
      followed by a reminder on the rules for arithmetic with real numbers,
      and a tour of the Cartesian coordinate plane.
      Students who are already comfortable with these topics can feel free to jump ahead to <xref ref="CmpNums"/>,
      where we introduce the complex numbers.
