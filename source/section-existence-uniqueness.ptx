  <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions</title>

  <p>
    So far, whenever we have solved a system of linear equations, we have always found exactly one solution.
    This is not always the case; we will find in this section that some systems do not have a solution, and others have more than one.
  </p>

  <p>
    We start with a very simple example.
    Consider the following linear system:
    <me>
      x-y=0
    </me>.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are obviously infinitely many solutions to this system; as long as <m>x=y</m>, we have a solution.
    We can picture all of these solutions by thinking of the graph of the equation <m>y=x</m> on the traditional <m>x,y</m> coordinate plane.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's continue this visual aspect of considering solutions to linear systems.
    Consider the system
    <md>
      <mrow>x+y \amp =2</mrow>
      <mrow>x-y \amp =0</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each of these equations can be viewed as lines in the coordinate plane,
    and since their slopes are different, we know they will intersect somewhere (see <xref ref="fig-visual_solutiona"/>).
    In this example, they intersect at the point <m>(1,1)</m> <mdash/> that is, when <m>x=1</m> and <m>y=1</m>,
    both equations are satisfied and we have a solution to our linear system.
    Since this is the only place the two lines intersect, this is the only solution.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now consider the linear system
    <md>
      <mrow>x+y \amp =1</mrow>
      <mrow>2x+2y \amp =2</mrow>
      </md>.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is clear that while we have two equations, they are essentially the same equation; the second is just a multiple of the first.
    Therefore, when we graph the two equations, we are graphing the same line twice
    (see <xref ref="fig-visual_solutionb"/>; the thicker line is used to represent drawing the line twice).
    In this case, we have an infinite solution set, just as if we only had the one equation <m>x+y=1</m>.
    We often write the solution as <m>x=1-y</m> to demonstrate that <m>y</m> can be any real number,
    and <m>x</m> is determined once we pick a value for <m>y</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, consider the linear system
    <md>
      <mrow>x+y \amp =1</mrow>
      <mrow>x+y \amp =2</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>

  <p>
    We should immediately spot a problem with this system; if the sum of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is 1, how can it also be 2?
    There is no solution to such a problem; this linear system has no solution.
    We can visualize this situation in <xref ref="fig-visual_solutionc"/>; the two lines are parallel and never intersect.

  <p>
    If we were to consider a linear system with three equations and two unknowns,
    we could visualize the solution by graphing the corresponding three lines.
    We can picture that perhaps all three lines would meet at one point, giving exactly 1 solution;
    perhaps all three equations describe the same line, giving an infinite number of solutions; perhaps we have different lines,
    but they do not all meet at the same point, giving no solution.
    We further visualize similar situations with, say, 20 equations with two variables.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the other hand, if we increase the number of variables to three, then we know from <xref ref="sec-planes"/>
    that the correct geometric visualization of the situation involves planes.
    A single equation such as
    <me>
      2x-3y+4z=7
    </me>
    describes a plane in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m> with normal vector <m>\vec n = \bbm 2\\-3\\4\ebm</m>.
    (By inspection, we can also choose a point on the plane.
    Since <m>3(-1)+4(1)=7</m>, we know that the point <m>(0,-1,1)</m> lies on the plane.)
  </p>

  <p>
    If we have two equations in three unknowns, three possibilities arise.
    The second equation could be a multiple of the first, in which case we still have our original plane.
    The second equation could also describe a parallel plane; for example, we might have
    <me>
      \begin{array}{ccccccc}
      2x\amp-\amp 3y\amp+\amp 4z\amp=\amp 7\\
      2x\amp-\amp 3y\amp+\amp 4z\amp=\amp 3
      \end{array}
    </me>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this case we know that there is no possible solution to the system, since there can be no point in common to these two parallel planes.
    The last possibility is that the planes are non-parallel, in which case they intersect in a line.
    For example, the system
    <me>
      \begin{array}{ccccccc}
      2x\amp-\amp 3y\amp+\amp 4z\amp=\amp 7\\
      -x\amp +\amp 3y\amp -\amp z\amp =\amp 1
      \end{array}
    </me>
    describes a pair of planes that intersect in the line (exercise)
    <me>
      \bbm x\\y\\z\ebm = \bbm 11\\3\\0\ebm + t\bbm -9\\-2\\1\ebm
    </me>.
  </p>

  <p>
    From here, we can go on to consider three or more equations in three variables;
    there might be no solution, or the planes might intersect in a single point,
    or along a common line, or they might even all describe the same plane.
  </p>

  <p>
    While it becomes harder to visualize when we add variables, no matter how many equations and variables we have,
    solutions to linear equations always come in one of three forms: exactly one solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solution.
    This is a fact that we will not prove here, but it deserves to be stated.
  </p>

      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    This leads us to a definition.
    Here we don't differentiate between having one solution and infinitely many solutions, but rather just whether or not a solution exists.

  <p>
    How can we tell what kind of solution (if one exists) a given system of linear equations has?
    The answer to this question lies with properly understanding the reduced row echelon form of a matrix.
    To discover what the solution is to a linear system, we first put the matrix into reduced row echelon form and then interpret that form properly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before we start with a simple example, let us make a note about finding the reduced row echelon form of a matrix.
  </p>

  <aside>
    <p>
      <alert>Technology Note:</alert> In the previous section,
      we learned how to find the reduced row echelon form of a matrix using Gaussian elimination <mdash/> by hand.
      We need to know how to do this; understanding the process has benefits.
      However, actually executing the process by hand for every problem is not usually beneficial.
      In fact, with large systems, computing the reduced row echelon form by hand is effectively impossible.
      The ability to use the RREF to quickly read off the solution to a system is probably more important
      than being able to find the RREF in the first place.
      There are plenty of programs available for free online that will do the Gaussian elimination for you,
      but use these with caution: you probably won't have access to a computer on the exams,
      so you'd better not become overly reliant on using software.
    </p>
  </aside>

  <p>
    As a general rule, when we are learning a new technique, it is best to not use technology to aid us.
    This helps us learn not only the technique but some of its <q>inner workings.</q>
    We can then use technology once we have mastered the technique and are now learning how to use it to solve problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    From here on out, in our examples, when we need the reduced row echelon form of a matrix, we will not show the steps involved.
    Rather, we will give the initial matrix, then immediately give the reduced row echelon form of the matrix.
    We trust that the reader can verify the accuracy of this form by both performing the necessary steps by hand or
    utilizing some technology to do it for them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our first example explores officially a quick example used in the introduction of this section.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="ex_ex_un_01">
    <title>Solving a linear system</title>
    <statement>

      <p>
        Find the solution to the linear system
        <me>
          \begin{array}{ccccc}
            x_1  \amp  + \amp  x_2 \amp  = \amp  1\\
            2x_1  \amp  + \amp  2x_2 \amp  = \amp 2
          \end{array}
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Create the corresponding augmented matrix, and then put the matrix into reduced row echelon form.
        <me>
          \left[\begin{array}{cc|c} 1 \amp 1 \amp 1\\2\amp 2\amp 2\end{array}\right] \qquad \overrightarrow{\text{rref}} \qquad \left[\begin{array}{cc|c} 1\amp 1\amp 1\\0\amp 0\amp 0\end{array}\right]
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now convert the reduced matrix back into equations.
        In this case, we only have one equation,
        <me>
          x_1+x_2=1
        </me>,
        or, equivalently,
        <md>
          <mrow>x_1  \amp =1-x_2</mrow>
          <mrow>x_2 \amp \text{ is a } \textit{free parameter}</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have just introduced a new term, <term>free parameter</term>, or free variable, or simply, <term>parameter</term>.
        It is used to stress that idea that <m>x_2</m> can take on <em>any</em> value;
        we are <q>free</q> to choose any value for <m>x_2</m>. Once this value is chosen, the value of <m>x_1</m> is determined.
        We have infinitely many choices for the value of <m>x_2</m>, so therefore we have infinitely many solutions.
        The variable <m>x_1</m> is also known as a <term>leading variable</term>,
        since the column corresponding to <m>x_1</m> contains a leading 1 in the reduced row echelon form of our augmented matrix.
          <idx><h>free variable</h></idx>
          <idx><h>variable</h><h>free</h></idx>
          <idx><h>parameter</h></idx>

      </p>

      <aside>
        <p>
          In other words, any free parameters in our system can be regarded as independent variables;
          the remaining variables are then seen as dependent variables,
          and the equations determined by the reduced row echelon form of our system tell us how the dependent variables depend on the parameters.
        </p>
      </aside>

      <p>
        For example, if we set <m>x_2 = 0</m>, then <m>x_1 = 1</m>; if we set <m>x_2 = 5</m>, then <m>x_1 = -4</m>.
        Common practice is to assign a new name to our free parameter; <m>t</m> is always a good choice.
        Doing so, we can write the solution to our system as follows:
        <md>
          <mrow>x_1 \amp = 1-t</mrow>
          <mrow>x_2 \amp = t</mrow>
        </md>,
        where <m>t</m> can be any real number.
        (Writing the solution in this way is meant to be reminiscent of the parametric equations for a line in <xref ref="sec-lines"/>.)
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <p>
    Let's try another example, one that uses more variables.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="ex_ex_un_1">
    <title>Solving another linear system</title>
    <statement>

      <p>
        Find the solution to the linear system

           x_1\amp   \amp  \amp +\amp 2x_3\amp =\amp 2\\
          \amp \amp -3x_2\amp +\amp 3x_3\amp =\amp -9

        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        To find the solution, put the corresponding matrix into reduced row echelon form.
        <me>
          \left[\begin{array}{ccc|c} 0 \amp 1 \amp -1\amp 3\\ 1\amp 0\amp 2\amp 2\\ 0\amp -3\amp 3\amp -9\end{array}\right] \qquad \overrightarrow{\text{rref}} \qquad \left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}1\amp 0\amp 2\amp 2\\ 0\amp 1\amp -1\amp 3\\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 0 \end{array}\right]
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now convert this reduced matrix back into equations.
        We have
        <md>
          <mrow>x_1 + 2x_3  \amp = 2 </mrow>
          <mrow>x_2-x_3 \amp =3 </mrow>
        </md>
        or, equivalently,
        <md>
          <mrow>x_1  \amp = 2-2t </mrow>
          <mrow>x_2 \amp =3+t</mrow>
          <mrow>x_3 \amp =t</mrow>
        </md>,
        where the parameter <m>t</m> can be any real number.
      </p>

      <p>
        These two equations tell us that the values of <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> depend on what <m>t=x_3</m> is.
        As we saw before, there is no restriction on what <m>t</m> must be; it is <q>free</q> to take on the value of any real number.
        Once <m>t</m> is chosen, we obtain a solution <m>(x_1,x_2,x_3)</m> to our system.
        Since we have infinitely many choices for the value of <m>t</m>, we have infinitely many solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        As examples, <m>x_1 = 2</m>, <m>x_2 = 3</m>, <m>x_3 = 0</m> is one solution; <m>x_1 = -2</m>, <m>x_2 = 5</m>, <m>x_3 = 2</m> is another solution.
        Try plugging these values back into the original equations to verify that these indeed are solutions.
        (By the way, since infinitely many solutions exist, this system of equations is consistent.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <idx><h>solution</h><h>particular</h></idx>
        <idx><h>solution</h><h>general</h></idx>
        Examples such as these are known as <term>particular solutions</term> to our system of equations;
        they correspond to a <term>particular</term> choice for the parameter <m>t</m>.
        The solution written in terms of the parameter <m>t</m> is known as the <term>general solution</term>to the system of equations.
        Note that we're not restricted to verifying particular solutions:
        we can go whole hog and plug the general solution into our system to make sure it works.
        For example, in the first equation, we have
        <me>
          x_2-x_3 = (3+t)-t = 3
        </me>,
        so the first equation is satisfied.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the second equation, we have
        <me>
          x_1+2x_3 = (2-2t)+2t = 2
        </me>,
        so the second equation is satisfied.
        The reader can just as easily verify that our solution works in the third equation as well.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <p>
    In the two previous examples we have used the word <q>free</q> to describe certain variables.
    What exactly is a free variable? How do we recognize which variables are free and which are not?
  </p>

  <p>
    Look back to the reduced matrix in <xref ref="ex_ex_un_01"/>.
    Notice that there is only one leading 1 in that matrix, and that leading 1 corresponded to the <m>x_1</m> variable.
    That told us that <m>x_1</m> was <em>not</em> a free variable; since <m>x_2</m> <em>did not</em> correspond to a leading 1, it was a free variable.

  </p>

  <p>
    Look also at the reduced matrix in <xref ref="ex_ex_un_1"/>. There were two leading 1s in that matrix;
    one corresponded to <m>x_1</m> and the other to <m>x_2</m>.
    This meant that <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> were not free variables;
    since there was not a leading 1 that corresponded to <m>x_3</m>, it was a free variable.
  </p>

  <p>
    We formally define this and a few other terms in this following definition.
  </p>


  <definition xml:id="def-free">

    These definitions help us understand when a consistent system of linear equations will have infinitely many solutions.
    If there are no free variables, then there is exactly one solution; if there are any free variables, there are infinitely many solutions.

    <p>
      If a consistent linear system of equations has a free variable, it has infinitely many solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a consistent linear system has more variables than leading 1s, then the system will have infinitely many solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      A consistent linear system with more variables than equations will always have infinitely many solutions.
    </p>
  </insight>

  <p>
    <alert>Note:</alert> <xref ref="idea-consistent"/> applies only to <em>consistent</em> systems.
    If a system is <em>inconsistent</em>, then no solution exists and talking about free and basic variables is meaningless.
  </p>

  <p>
    When a consistent system has only one solution,
    each equation that comes from the reduced row echelon form of the corresponding augmented matrix will contain exactly one variable.
    If the consistent system has infinitely many solutions,
    then there will be at least one equation coming from the reduced row echelon form that contains more than one variable.
    The <q>first</q> variable will be the basic (or dependent) variable; all others will be free variables.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have now seen examples of consistent systems with exactly one solution and others with infinitely many solutions.
    How will we recognize that a system is inconsistent? Let's find out through an example.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="ex_ex_un_2">
    <title>An inconsistent system</title>
    <statement>

      <p>
        Find the solution to the linear system
        <me>
          \begin{array}{ccccccc}
            x_1\amp +\amp x_2\amp +\amp x_3\amp =\amp 1\\
            x_1\amp +\amp 2x_2\amp +\amp x_3\amp =\amp 2\\
            2x_1\amp +\amp 3x_2\amp +\amp 2x_3\amp =\amp 0
          \end{array}
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We start by putting the corresponding matrix into reduced row echelon form.
        <me>
          \left[\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 \amp 1 \amp 1\amp 1\\1\amp 2\amp 1\amp 2\\ 2\amp 3\amp 2\amp 0\\ \end{array}\right] \qquad \overrightarrow{\text{rref}} \qquad \left[\begin{array}{ccc|c} 1\amp 0\amp 1\amp 0\\ 0\amp 1\amp 0\amp 0\\ 0\amp 0\amp 0\amp 1\\ \end{array}\right]
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now let us take the reduced matrix and write out the corresponding equations.
        The first two rows give us the equations
        <md>
          <mrow>x_1+x_3 \amp =0</mrow>
          <mrow>x_2  \amp = 0</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>

      <p>
        So far, so good.
        However the last row gives us the equation
        <me>
          0x_1+0x_2+0x_3 = 1
        </me>,
        or, more concisely, <m>0=1</m>. Obviously, this is not true; we have reached a contradiction.
        Therefore, no solution exists; this system is inconsistent.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <p>
    In previous sections we have only encountered linear systems with unique solutions (exactly one solution).
    Now we have seen three more examples with different solution types.
    The first two examples in this section had infinitely many solutions, and the third had no solution.
    How can we tell if a system is inconsistent?
  </p>

  <p>
    A linear system will be inconsistent only when it implies that 0 equals 1.
    We can tell if a linear system implies this by putting its corresponding augmented matrix into reduced row echelon form.
    If we have any row where all entries are 0 except for the entry in the last column, then the system implies <m>0=1</m>.
    More succinctly, if we have a leading 1 in the last column of an augmented matrix, then the linear system has no solution.
  </p>

  <insight xml:id="idea-inconsistent">
    <title>Inconsistent Systems of Linear Equations</title>
    <p>
      <idx><h>system of linear equations</h><h>inconsistent</h></idx>
      <idx><h>leading one</h></idx>
      A system of linear equations is inconsistent if the reduced row echelon form of its corresponding augmented matrix has a leading 1 in the last column.
    </p>
  </insight>

  <example xml:id="ex_ex_un_3">
    <title>Verifying that a system is inconsistent</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Confirm that the linear system
        <me>
          \begin{array}{ccccc}
            \amp + \amp y\amp =\amp 0\\
            2x \amp +\amp 2y\amp =\amp 4
          \end{array}
        </me>
        has no solution.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We can verify that this system has no solution in two ways.
        First, let's just think about it.
        If <m>x+y=0</m>, then it stands to reason, by multiplying both sides of this equation by 2, that <m>2x+2y = 0</m>.
        However, the second equation of our system says that <m>2x+2y= 4</m>. Since <m>0\neq 4</m>,
        we have a contradiction and hence our system has no solution.
        (We cannot possibly pick values for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> so that <m>2x+2y</m> equals both 0 and 4.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Now let us confirm this using the prescribed technique from above.
        The reduced row echelon form  of the corresponding augmented matrix is
        <me>
          \left[\begin{array}{cc|c} 1 \amp 1 \amp 0\\0\amp 0\amp 1\\ \end{array}\right]
        </me>.
        We have a leading 1 in the last column, so therefore the system is inconsistent.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <p>
    Let's summarize what we have learned up to this point.
    Consider the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix of a system of linear equations.
    (That sure seems like a mouthful in and of itself.
    However, it boils down to <q>look at the reduced form of the usual matrix.</q>)
    If there is a leading 1 in the last column, the system has no solution.
    Otherwise, if there is a leading 1 for each variable, then there is exactly one solution; otherwise
    there are infinitely many solutions. (<ie/>, there are free variables.)
  </p>

  <p>
    Systems with exactly one solution or no solution are the easiest to deal with;
    systems with infinitely many solutions are a bit harder to deal with.
    Therefore, we'll do a little more practice.
    First, a definition: if there are infinitely many solutions, what do we call one of those infinitely many solutions?
  </p>


  <definition xml:id="def-particular">
    <title>Particular Solution</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider a linear system of equations with infinitely many solutions.
        A <term>particular solution</term> is one solution out of the infinitely many set of possible solutions.
        <idx><h>particular solution</h></idx>
        <idx><h>solution</h><h>particular</h></idx>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    The easiest way to find a particular solution is to pick values for the free variables which then determines the values of the dependent variables.
    Again, more practice is called for.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="ex_ex_un_4">
    <title>Finding general and particular solutions</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Give the general solution to a linear system whose augmented matrix in reduced row echelon form is

      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We can essentially ignore the third row; it does not divulge any information about the solution.
      </p>

      <aside>
        <p>
          Why include the row of zeros in <xref ref="ex_ex_un_4"/>?
          Rows of zeros sometimes appear <q>unexpectedly</q> in matrices after they have been put in reduced row echelon form.
          When this happens, we do learn <em>something</em>; it means that at least one equation was a combination of some of the others.
        </p>
      </aside>

      <p>
        The first and second rows can be rewritten as the following equations:
        <md>
          <mrow>x_1 - x_2 + 2x_4  \amp =4 </mrow>
          <mrow>x_3 - 3x_4  \amp = 7</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Notice how the variables <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_3</m> correspond to the leading 1s of the given matrix.
        Therefore <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_3</m> are dependent variables; all other variables (in this case, <m>x_2</m> and <m>x_4</m>) are free variables.
      </p>

      <p>
        We generally write our solution with the dependent variables on the left and independent variables and constants on the right.
        It is also a good practice to acknowledge the fact that our free variables are, in fact, free.
        So our final solution would look something like
        <md>
          <mrow>x_1  \amp = 4 + s - 2t </mrow>
          <mrow>x_2  \amp = s \text{ is free} </mrow>
          <mrow>x_3  \amp = 7+3t </mrow>
          <mrow>x_4  \amp = t \text{ is free}</mrow>
         </md>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that in this case we have <em>two</em> free variables, <m>x_2</m> and <m>x_4</m>,
        so we introduce two parameters, <m>s</m> and <m>t</m>, in our general solution.
        While we would be correct in saying that this system has infinitely many solutions,
        we can be more precise about the nature of those solutions.
        Here, we say that we have a <term>two-parameter family of solutions</term>,
        to indicate the fact that two different parameters are required to describe the most general solution.
      </p>

      <aside>
        <p>
          <alert>Note:</alert> It's useful to state the number of parameters in the general solution to a system with infinitely many solutions,
          since the number of parameters has geometric significance.
          A one-parameter family of solutions defines a <em>line</em>, while a two-parameter family of solutions defines a <em>plane</em>.
        </p>
      </aside>

      <p>
        To find particular solutions, choose values for our free variables.
        There is no <q>right</q> way of doing this; we are <q>free</q> to choose whatever we wish.
      </p>

      <p>
        By setting <m>x_2 = 0 = x_4</m>, we have the solution <m>x_1 = 4</m>, <m>x_2 = 0</m>, <m>x_3 = 7</m>, <m>x_4 = 0</m>.
        By setting <m>x_2 = 1</m> and <m>x_4 = -5</m>, we have the solution <m>x_1 = 15</m>, <m>x_2 = 1</m>, <m>x_3 = -8</m>, <m>x_4 = -5</m>.
        It is easier to read this when are variables are listed vertically, so we repeat these solutions:

          What kind of situation would lead to a column of all zeros? To have such a column,
          the original matrix needed to have a column of all zeros, meaning that while we acknowledged the existence of a certain variable,
          we never actually used it in any equation.
          In practical terms, we could respond by removing the corresponding column from the matrix and just keep in mind that that variable is free.

    The constants and coefficients of a matrix work together to determine whether a given system of linear equations has one,
    infinitely many, or no solution.
    The concept will be fleshed out more in later chapters, but in short, the coefficients determine whether a matrix will have exactly one solution or not.
    In the <q>or not</q> case, the constants determine whether or not infinitely many solutions or no solution exists.
    (So if a given linear system has exactly one solution, it will always have exactly one solution even if the constants are changed.)
    Let's look at an example to get an idea of how the values of constants and coefficients work together to determine the solution type.

        In looking at the second row, we see that if <m>k=6</m>, then that row contains only zeros and <m>x_2</m> is a free variable; we have infinitely many solutions.
        If <m>k\neq 6</m>, then our next step would be to make that second row, second column entry a leading one.
        We don't particularly care about the solution, only that we would have exactly one as both <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> would correspond to a leading one and hence be dependent variables.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our final analysis is then this.
        If <m>k\neq 6</m>, there is exactly one solution; if <m>k=6</m>, there are infinitely many solutions.
        In this example, it is not possible to have no solutions.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <p>
    As an extension of the previous example, consider the similar augmented matrix where the constant 9 is replaced with a 10.
    Performing the same elementary row operation gives
    <me>
      \left[\begin{array}{cc|c} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3\\3\amp k\amp 10\end{array}\right] \qquad \overrightarrow{-3R_1+R_2\rightarrow R_2} \qquad \left[\begin{array}{cc|c} 1\amp 2\amp 3\\0\amp k-6\amp 1\end{array}\right]
    </me>.
  </p>

  <p>
    As in the previous example, if <m>k\neq6</m>, we can make the second row, second column entry a leading one and hence we have one solution.
    However, if <m>k=6</m>, then our last row is <m>[0\ 0\ 1]</m>, meaning we have no solution.

    We have been studying the solutions to linear systems mostly in an <q>academic</q> setting;
    we have been solving systems for the sake of solving systems.
    In the next section, we'll look at situations which create linear systems that need solving
    (<ie/>, <q>word problems</q>).
