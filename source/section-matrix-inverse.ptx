  <title>The Matrix Inverse</title>

  <p>
    Once again we visit the old algebra equation, <m>ax=b</m>. How do we solve for <m>x</m>? We know that, as long as <m>a\neq 0</m>,
    <me>
      x = \frac{b}{a}, \ \text{or, stated in another way,} \ x = a^{-1}b
    </me>.
  </p>

  <p>
    What is <m>a^{-1}</m>? It is the number that, when multiplied by <m>a</m>, returns 1. That is,
    <me>
      a^{-1}a = 1
    </me>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let us now think in terms of matrices.
    We have learned of the identity matrix <m>I</m> that <q>acts like the number 1.</q>
    That is, if <m>A</m> is a square matrix, then
    <me>
      IA = AI = A
    </me>.
    If we had a matrix, which we'll call <m>A^{-1}</m>, where <m>A^{-1}A=I</m>,
    then by analogy to our algebra example above it seems like we might be able to solve the linear system
    <m>A\vx = \vb</m> for <m>\vx</m> by multiplying both sides of the equation by <m>A^{-1}</m>. That is, perhaps
    <me>
      \vx = A^{-1}\vb
    </me>.
    There is no guarantee that such a matrix is going to exist for an arbitrary <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>,
    but if it does, we say that <m>A</m> is <em>invertible</em>.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-inverse">
    <title>Invertible Matrices and the Inverse of <m>A</m></title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <idx><h>matrix</h><h>inverse</h></idx>
        <idx><h>inverse</h><h>definition</h></idx>

        We say that an <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is <term>invertible</term> if there exists a matrix <m>X</m> such that
        <me>
          AX = XA = I_n
        </me>.
        When this is the case, we call the matrix <m>X</m> the <term>inverse</term> of <m>A</m> and write <m>X=A^{-1}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Of course, there is a lot of speculation here.
    We don't know in general that such a matrix like <m>A^{-1}</m> exists.
    (And if it does, whether that matrix is <em>unique</em>,
    despite the use of the definite article in stating that <m>X</m> is <q>the</q> inverse of <m>A</m>.)
    However, we do know how to solve the matrix equation <m>AX = B</m>,
    so we can use that technique to solve the equation <m>AX = I</m> for <m>X</m>.
    This seems like it will get us close to what we want. Let's practice this once and then study our results.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="ex_inverse_1">
    <title>Solving <m>AX=I</m></title>
    <statement>

      <p>
        Let
        <me>
          A = \bbm 2 \amp 1\\1 \amp 1\ebm
        </me>.
        Find a matrix <m>X</m> such that <m>AX = I</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We know how to solve this from the previous section: we form the proper augmented matrix,
        put it into reduced row echelon form and interpret the results.
        <me>
          \bbm 2 \amp 1 \amp 1\amp 0\\1\amp 1\amp 0\amp 1\ebm \quad \arref \quad \bbm 1\amp 0\amp 1\amp -1\\0\amp 1\amp -1\amp 2\ebm
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        We read from our matrix that
        <me>
          X = \bbm 1 \amp -1\\-1 \amp 2\ebm
        </me>.
        Let's check our work:
        <md>
          <mrow>AX \amp  = \bbm 2\amp 1\\1\amp 1\ebm\bbm 1\amp -1\\-1\amp 2\ebm</mrow>
          <mrow>        \amp  = \bbm 1\amp 0\\0\amp 1\ebm</mrow>
          <mrow>        \amp  = I</mrow>
        </md>
        Sure enough, it works.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <p>
    Looking at our previous example, we are tempted to jump in and call the matrix <m>X</m> that we found <q><m>A^{-1}</m>.</q>
    However, there are two obstacles in the way of us doing this.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, we know that in general <m>AB \neq BA</m>.
    So while we found that <m>AX = I</m>, we can't automatically assume that <m>XA=I</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Secondly, we have seen examples of matrices where <m>AB = AC</m>, but <m>B\neq C</m>.
    So just because <m>AX = I</m>, it is possible that another matrix <m>Y</m> exists where <m>AY = I</m>.
    If this is the case, using the notation <m>A^{-1}</m> would be misleading, since it could refer to more than one matrix.
  </p>

  <p>
    These obstacles that we face are not insurmountable.
    The first obstacle was that we know that <m>AX=I</m> but didn't know that <m>XA=I</m>.
    That's easy enough to check, though. Let's look at <m>A</m> and <m>X</m> from our previous example.
    <md>
      <mrow>XA \amp = \bbm 1\amp -1\\-1\amp 2\ebm\bbm 2\amp 1\\1\amp 1\ebm</mrow>
      <mrow>        \amp =\bbm 1\amp 0\\0\amp 1\ebm</mrow>
      <mrow>        \amp =I</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Perhaps this first obstacle isn't much of an obstacle after all.
    Of course, we only have one example where it worked, so this doesn't mean that it always works.
    We have good news, though: it always does work. The only <q>bad</q> news is that this is a bit harder to prove.
    For now, we will state it as theorem, but the proof will have to wait until later:
    see the proof of <xref ref="thm-IMT"/>.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm-inverse1">
    <title>Special Commuting Matrix Products</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n\times n</m> matrix.
        <ol>
        <li>
          <p>

        </li>
       </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <aside vshift="0">
    <p>
      <alert>Note:</alert> <xref ref="thm-inverse1"/> only applies to <em>square</em> matrices.
      If <m>A</m> is an <m>m\times n</m> matrix, with <m>m\neq n</m>,
      it is sometimes possible to find an <m>n\times m</m> matrix <m>B</m> such that <m>AB=I_m</m>
      (in this case <m>B</m> is called a <q>right inverse</q> for <m>A</m>),
      or an <m>n\times m</m> matrix <m>C</m> such that <m>CA = I_n</m> (a <q>left inverse</q> for <m>A</m>).
      However, the only case where <m>A</m> has both a left <em>and</em> a right inverse is when <m>m=n</m>, in which case <m>B=C</m>.
      If <m>m\lt n</m>, only a right inverse is possible, while if <m>m\gt n</m>, only a left inverse is possible.
    </p>
  </aside>

  <p>
    The second obstacle is easier to address.
    We want to know if another matrix <m>Y</m> exists where <m>AY = I =YA</m>.
    Let's suppose that it does. Consider the expression <m>XAY</m>.
    Since matrix multiplication is associative, we can group this any way we choose.
    We could group this as <m>(XA)Y</m>; this results in
    <md>
      <mrow>(XA)Y	\amp = IY</mrow>
      <mrow>              \amp = Y</mrow>
    </md>.
    We could also group <m>XAY</m> as <m>X(AY)</m>. This tells us
    <md>
      <mrow>X(AY) \amp = XI</mrow>
      <mrow>  \amp = X</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Combining the two ideas above, we see that <m>X = XAY = Y</m>; that is, <m>X=Y</m>.
    We conclude that there is only one matrix <m>X</m> where <m>XA = I = AX</m>.
    (Even if we think we have two, we can do the above exercise and see that we really just have one.)
  </p>

  <p>
    We have just proved the following theorem.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm-inverse_unique">
    <title>Uniqueness of Solutions to <m>AX=I_n</m></title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <idx><h>inverse</h><h>uniqueness</h></idx>

        Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n\times n</m> matrix and let <m>X</m> be a matrix where <m>AX = I_n</m>.
        Then <m>X</m> is unique; it is the only matrix that satisfies this equation.
        In other words, if <m>A</m> is an <m>n\times n</m> matrix and <m>AX = AY = I_n</m>, then <m>X=Y = A^{-1}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    Thus, we were justified in <xref ref="def-inverse"/> in calling <m>A^{-1}</m> <q>the</q> inverse of <m>A</m>
    (rather than merely <q>an</q> inverse). <xref ref="thm-inverse_unique"/> is incredibly important in practice.
    It tells us that if we are able to establish that <em>either</em> <m>AX=I_n</m> or <m>XA = I_n</m> for some matrix <m>X</m>,
    then we can immediately conclude two things: first, that <m>A</m> is invertible, and second, that <m>A=A^{-1}</m>.
    We put this observation to use in the next example.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="ex_using_uniqueness">
    <title>Using Theorems <xref ref="thm-inverse1"/> and <xref ref="thm-inverse_unique"/></title>
    <statement>

      <p>
        Suppose <m>A</m> is an <m>n\times n</m> matrix such that <m>A^5 = I_n</m>.
        Prove that <m>A</m> is invertible, and find an expression for <m>A^{-1}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Using <xref ref="thm-inverse_unique"/>, we can quickly kill two birds with one stone.
        Using properties of exponents (and the fact that <m>5=1+4</m>), we have
        <me>
          A^5 = A\cdot (A\cdot A\cdot A\cdot A) = A(A^4) = I_n
        </me>.
        Thus, if we set <m>X=A^4</m>, then <m>AX = I_n</m>,
        so by Theorems <xref ref="thm-inverse1"/> and <xref ref="thm-inverse_unique"/>,
        <m>A</m> is invertible, and <m>A^{-1} = A^4</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <p>
    At this point, it is natural to wonder which <m>n\times n</m> matrices will be invertible.
    Will any non-zero matrix do? (No.) Are such matrices a rare occurrence? (No.)
    As we proceed through this chapter and the next,
    we will see that there are many different conditions one can place on an <m>n\times n</m>
    matrix that are equivalent to the statement <q>The matrix <m>A</m> is invertible.</q>
    Before we begin our attempt to answer this question in general, let's look at a particular example.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="ex_inverse_2">
    <title>A non-invertible matrix</title>
    <statement>

      <p>
        Find the inverse of <m>A = \bbm 1\amp 2\\2\amp 4\ebm</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        By solving the equation <m>AX = I</m> for <m>X</m> will give us the inverse of <m>A</m>.
        Forming the appropriate augmented matrix and finding its reduced row echelon form gives us
        <me>
          \bbm 1 \amp 2 \amp 1\amp 0\\2\amp 4\amp 0\amp 1\ebm \quad \arref \quad \bbm 1\amp 2\amp 0\amp 1/2\\0\amp 0\amp 1\amp -1/2\ebm
        </me>
        Yikes! We were expecting to find that the reduced row echelon form of this matrix would look like
        <me>
          \bbm I  \amp  A^{-1}\ebm
        </me>.
        However, we don't have the identity on the left hand side. Our conclusion: <m>A</m> is not invertible.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <aside xml:id="footnote-special" vshift="0">
    <p>
      <xref ref="ex_inverse_2"/> shows that not all square matrices (or even non-zero square matrices) are invertible,
      hence <xref ref="def-inverse"/> is necessary: why bother calling <m>A</m> <q>invertible</q> if every square matrix is?
      If everyone is special, then no one is. Then again, everyone <em>is</em> special.
    </p>
  </aside>

  <p>
    We have just seen that not all matrices are invertible.
    The attentive reader might have been able to spot the source of the trouble in the previous example:
    notice that the second row of <m>A</m> is a multiple of the first,
    so that the row operation <m>R_2-2R_1\to R_2</m> created a row of zeros.
    Can you think what sort of condition would signal trouble for a general <m>n\times n</m> matrix?
    Here, we need to think back to our discussions of the various theoretical concepts we've encountered,
    such as rank, span, linear independence, and so on. Let us think of the rows of <m>A</m> as row vectors.
  </p>

  <p>
    The elementary row operations that we perform on a matrix either rearrange these vectors,
    or create new vectors that are linear combinations of the old ones.
    The only way we end up with a row of zeros in the reduced row echelon form of <m>A</m>
    is if one of the rows of <m>A</m> can be written as a linear combination of the others;
    that is, if the rows of <m>A</m> are <em>linearly dependent</em>.
    We also know that if there is a row of zeros in the reduced row echelon form of <m>A</m>,
    then not every row contains a leading 1.
    Recalling that the rank of <m>A</m> is equal to the number of leading 1s in the reduced row echelon form of <m>A</m>,
    we have the following:
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm-rank_and_inverse">
    <title>Inverses and rank</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n\times n</m> matrix. Then the following statements are equivalent:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The matrix <m>A</m> is invertible.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The rank of <m>A</m> is equal to <m>n</m>.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The rows of <m>A</m> are linearly independent.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The columns of <m>A</m> are linearly independent.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <aside vshift="0">
    <p>
      Here's a useful exercise for the reader to consider:
      can you prove in general that for a <m>2\times 2</m> matrix <m>A</m>,
      if one row of <m>A</m> is a multiple of the other, then the same is true of the columns?
      (We can see that this is the case in <xref ref="ex_inverse_2"/>.)
      A fundamental theorem in linear algebra states that for a general <m>m\times n</m> matrix,
      the number of linearly independent rows is equal to the number of linearly independent columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proof of this fact is rather technical, so we have not included it in this book.
      However, the rough idea is to follow the leading 1s: in the reduced row echelon form of <m>A</m>,
      each leading 1 occupies both a row and a column, and the rows (or columns)
      that end up with leading 1s are the ones that are linearly independent.
    </p>
  </aside>

  <p>
    The claim that <q>the following statements are equivalent</q> in <xref ref="thm-rank_and_inverse"/>
    means that as soon as we know that one of the statements on the list is true,
    we can immediately conclude that the others are true as well. This is also the case if we know one of the statements is false.
    For example, if we know that <m>\operatorname{rank}(A)\lt n</m>,
    then we can immediately conclude that <m>A</m> will not be invertible.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's sum up what we've learned so far. We've discovered that if a matrix has an inverse, it has only one.
    Therefore, we gave that special matrix a name, <q><em>the</em> inverse.</q>
    Finally, we describe the most general way to find the inverse of a matrix, and a way to tell if it does not have one.

        \bbm a \amp b \amp 1\amp 0\\c\amp d\amp 0\amp 1\ebm
      </me>
      into reduced row echelon form and you'll discover the result of the theorem.
      Alternatively, multiply <m>A</m> by what we propose is the inverse and see that we indeed get <m>I</m>.
      It turns out that <xref ref="thm-2by2"/> is a special case of a general formula for the inverse of a matrix in terms of
      <em>determinants</em>. We will discuss determinants in the next chapter.
      While useful in certain theoretical situations, the determinant formula for the inverse is only a shortcut in the <m>2\times 2</m> case.
      For larger matrices, the method given in this section is computationally much faster.

  <p>
    We started this section out by speculating that just as we solved algebraic equations of the form
    <m>ax=b</m> by computing <m>x = a^{-1}b</m>,
    we might be able to solve matrix equations of the form <m>A\vx = \vb</m> by computing <m>\vx = A^{-1}\vb</m>.
    If <m>A^{-1}</m> does exist, then we <em>can</em> solve the equation <m>A\vx = \vb</m> this way. Consider:
    <md>
      <mrow>A \vx \amp = \vb \amp  \amp  \text{ (original equation)}</mrow>
      <mrow>A^{-1}A\vx \amp = A^{-1}\vb \amp  \amp \text{ (multiply both sides on the left by } A^{-1})</mrow>
      <mrow>I\vx \amp = A^{-1}\vb \amp  \amp \text{ (since } A^{-1}A=I)</mrow>
      <mrow>\vx \amp = A^{-1}\vb \amp  \amp \text{ (since } I\vx = \vx)</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's step back and think about this for a moment.
    The only thing we know about the equation <m>A\vx = \vb</m> is that <m>A</m> is invertible.
    We also know that solutions to <m>A\vx = \vb</m> come in three forms:
    exactly one solution, infinitely many solutions, and no solution.
    We just showed that if <m>A</m> is invertible, then <m>A\vx = \vb</m> has <em>at least</em> one solution.
    We showed that by setting <m>\vx</m> equal to  <m>A^{-1}\vb</m>, we have a solution. Is it possible that more solutions exist?
  </p>

  <p>
    No. Suppose we are told that a known vector <m>\vvv</m> is a solution to the equation <m>A\vx = \vb</m>;
    that is, we know that <m>A\vvv=\vb</m>. We can repeat the above steps:
    <md>
      <mrow>A\vvv \amp =\vb</mrow>
      <mrow>A^{-1}A\vvv  \amp =A^{-1}\vb </mrow>
      <mrow>I\vvv  \amp = A^{-1}\vb </mrow>
      <mrow>\vvv  \amp = A^{-1}\vb </mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This shows that <em>all</em> solutions to <m>A\vx = \vb</m> are exactly <m>\vx = A^{-1}\vb</m> when <m>A</m> is invertible.
    We have just proved the following theorem.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm-inverse_solution">
    <title>Invertible Matrices and Solutions to <m>A\vx = \vb</m></title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <idx><h>solution</h><h>unique</h></idx>

        Let <m>A</m> be an invertible <m>n\times n</m> matrix, and let  be any <m>n\times 1</m> column vector.
        Then the equation <m>A\vx = \vb</m> has exactly one solution, namely
        <me>
          \vx = A^{-1}\vb
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <aside vshift="0">

      A <em>corollary</em>is an idea that follows directly from a theorem;
      typically, all the hard work is done in proving the theorem, and any resulting corollaries are easy consequences.
    </p>
  </aside>

  <p>
    A corollary to this theorem is: If <m>A</m> is not invertible, then <m>A\vx = \vb</m> does not have exactly one solution.
    It may have infinitely many solutions and it may have no solution,
    and we would need to examine the reduced row echelon form of the augmented matrix
    <m>\bbm A \amp  \vb \ebm</m> to see which case applies.

    We demonstrate our theorem with an example.

          The only scenario where you should consider using the inverse to solve a system (aside from being asked to do so on a test!)

    Knowing a matrix is invertible is incredibly useful. Among many other reasons, if you know <m>A</m> is invertible,
    then you know for sure that <m>A\vx = \vb</m> has a solution (as we just stated in <xref ref="thm-inverse_solution"/>).
    In the next section we'll demonstrate many different properties of invertible matrices,
    including stating several different ways in which we know that a matrix is invertible.

      As odd as it may sound, <em>knowing</em> a matrix is invertible is useful;
